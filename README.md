#DEEP_LEARNING_PROJECT:

Recognition of Digits and Characters using CNN 

#CNN-ALPHABET CLASSIFIER

A Kaggle dataset A_Z Handwritten Data in .csv format
In this code i have used keras library with tensorflow backend

#DATASET:

Dataset can be downloaded here
https://www.kaggle.com/ashishguptajiit/handwritten-az


#REQUIREMENTS:

Python 3.5,
Scikit learn,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Keras,
Tensorflow

#HOW TO RUN:

First run the Data_preparation.py file for data to be processed first and then run the train.py file to train the model, you can run train.py file as many times you want.

#CNN-DIGIT-CLASSIFIER:

The dataset is loaded from a MNIST handwritten digits dataset where each image is a 28 by 28 pixel(784 pixels in total).
The digit_recognition.py file is executed for digit recognition task.As such there are 10 digits (0 to 9) or 10 classes to predict. Results are reported using prediction error, which is nothing more than the inverted classification accuracy.
